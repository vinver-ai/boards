# Vinver, Inc. Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Thank you for your interest in contributing to open source software projects
managed by Vinver, Inc. ("Vinver"). This Individual Contributor License
Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to
Vinver.

By submitting a Contribution (as defined below), you accept and agree to the
following terms and conditions for your present and future Contributions
submitted to Vinver. Except for the license granted herein, you reserve all
right, title, and interest in and to your Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** means the individual who submits a Contribution to
Vinver.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
submitted by You to Vinver for inclusion in, or documentation of, any
project owned or managed by Vinver (the "Work"). "Submitted" means any form
of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Vinver, including
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Vinver.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
Vinver and to recipients of software distributed by Vinver a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative
works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
Vinver and to recipients of software distributed by Vinver a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your
Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that
entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as
of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Representations

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer(s)
has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your
Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such
rights for your Contributions to Vinver, or that your employer has executed a
separate Corporate Contributor License Agreement with Vinver.

(b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 6 for
submissions on behalf of others).

(c) Your Contribution does not include any third-party code, or if it does,
You have identified such code and its license in writing with the submission.

## 5. Support; Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the
extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a
fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. Contributions on Behalf of Others

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
submit it to Vinver separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete
details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but
not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which
you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on
behalf of a third party: [named here]."

## 7. Notification

You agree to notify Vinver of any facts or circumstances of which you become
aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
