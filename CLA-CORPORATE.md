# Vinver, Inc. Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Thank you for your interest in contributing to open source software projects
managed by Vinver, Inc. ("Vinver"). This Corporate Contributor License
Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by corporate contributors
to Vinver.

This Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit Contributions
to Vinver, to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees,
and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto.

By submitting a Contribution (as defined below), the Corporation accepts and
agrees to the following terms and conditions for its present and future
Contributions submitted to Vinver.

## 1. Definitions

**"Corporation"** means the legal entity that is making this Agreement with
Vinver. The entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered
to be a single Corporation.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
submitted by the Corporation to Vinver for inclusion in, or documentation of,
any project owned or managed by Vinver (the "Work").

**"Designated Employees"** means the employees of the Corporation who are
authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation. The initial
list of Designated Employees is provided in Schedule A below and may be
updated by the Corporation.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Corporation hereby
grants to Vinver and to recipients of software distributed by Vinver a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Contributions and such derivative
works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Corporation hereby
grants to Vinver and to recipients of software distributed by Vinver a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by the Corporation that
are necessarily infringed by the Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
the Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
If any entity institutes patent litigation against the Corporation or any other
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Contribution, or the Work to which the Corporation has contributed,
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or
Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Representations

The Corporation represents that:

(a) It is legally entitled to grant the above licenses. Each Designated
Employee is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.

(b) Each Contribution is the Corporation's original creation (see Section 6
for submissions on behalf of others).

(c) No Contribution includes any third-party code, or if it does, the
Corporation has identified such code and its license in writing with the
submission.

## 5. Support; Warranty Disclaimer

The Corporation is not expected to provide support for its Contributions,
except to the extent the Corporation desires to provide support. Unless
required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the Corporation provides
its Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. Contributions on Behalf of Others

Should the Corporation wish to submit work that is not its original creation,
it may submit it to Vinver separately from any Contribution, identifying the
complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
agreements) of which the Corporation is aware, and conspicuously marking the
work as "Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]."

## 7. Notification

The Corporation agrees to notify Vinver of any facts or circumstances of which
it becomes aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any
respect.
